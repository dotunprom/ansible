#- name: print catalogue
#  debug:
#    msg: catalogue
#
#
#  1. Let's now set up the catalogue application.
#  # curl -fsSL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | bash -
#  # yum install nodejs gcc-c++ -y
#
#  As part of operating system standards, we run all the applications and databases as a normal user but not with root user.
#
#  So to run the catalogue service we choose to run as a normal user and that user name should be more relevant to the project. Hence we will use `roboshop` as the username to run the service.
#
#  ```bash
#  # useradd roboshop
#
#  ```
#
#  1. So let's switch to the `roboshop` user and run the following commands.
#
#  ```bash
#  $ curl -s -L -o /tmp/catalogue.zip "https://github.com/roboshop-devops-project/catalogue/archive/main.zip"
#  $ cd /home/roboshop
#  $ unzip /tmp/catalogue.zip
#  $ mv catalogue-main catalogue
#  $ cd /home/roboshop/catalogue
#  $ npm install
#
#  ```
#
#  1. Update SystemD file with correct IP addresses
#
#  Update `MONGO_DNSNAME` with MongoDB Server IP
#
#  2. Now, lets set up the service with systemctl.
